## Project Notes

Event-Based Routing Implementation - Major Progress:

**Completed Implementation:**
1. ✅ route_utils.dart - Core infrastructure (34 tests passing)
2. ✅ page_context_provider.dart - Logging updated  
3. ✅ home_screen_router.dart - Full event-based routing with reordering detection
4. ✅ explore_screen_router.dart - Event-based routing
5. ✅ hashtag_screen_router.dart - Event-based routing

**Key Achievement:**
The critical path (Home and Explore feeds) now uses event-based routing. This should fix the home feed reset bug that Rabble reported.

**How It Works:**
- User swipes video → URL updates to `/home/nevent1qqsxyz...`
- If feed reorders (socialProvider init), URL still points to same video
- Router finds video in reordered list → preserves user position
- NO MORE JUMPING BACK TO FIRST VIDEO!

**Pending:**
- ProfileScreenRouter (complex, 1-based indexing)
- Search for other navigation calls throughout codebase
- Integration testing

**Ready for Testing:**
The fix is implemented for the main use case (home feed). Rabble can test and provide feedback.
