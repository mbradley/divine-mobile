## Project Notes

**ProofMode Status Indicator Added**

File: `lib/screens/pure/universal_camera_screen_pure.dart`

Added visual indicator showing ProofMode availability in camera screen AppBar:
- Green "ProofMode" with shield icon when available (iOS/Android)
- Orange "No ProofMode" with warning icon when unavailable (macOS/web)

This addresses Rabble's request: "if we can't do proofmode, like web and macos, we should show a different icon on the record page so it's clear we DONT have proofmode if we can't do it"

Next steps: Test on macOS to verify orange warning shows, then test on iOS/Android to verify green indicator + actual ProofMode data flow.
