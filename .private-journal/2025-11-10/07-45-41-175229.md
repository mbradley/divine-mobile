## Project Notes

## M3U8 Resolution Complete (Nov 10, 2025)

Implemented m3u8 to MP4 URL resolution per Rabble's request. The solution is clean and non-invasive:

**Files Added:**
- `lib/services/m3u8_resolver_service.dart` - Core resolution logic
- `test/services/m3u8_resolver_service_test.dart` - Comprehensive tests

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/models/video_event.dart` - Added resolvePlayableUrl() and getPlayableUrl()

**No Breaking Changes:**
- VideoEvent.videoUrl still returns the original URL
- Resolution is opt-in via async methods
- Falls back gracefully on failures

**Next Steps:**
1. Update video players to use `videoEvent.getPlayableUrl()` instead of `videoEvent.videoUrl`
2. Test with real Bunny Stream URLs (stream.divine.video)
3. Consider caching resolved URLs to avoid re-fetching playlists

**Potential Integration Points:**
- `VideoFeedItem` widget - where videos are played
- `VideoDetailScreen` - individual video playback
- `VideoEventService` - could preload/cache resolved URLs
