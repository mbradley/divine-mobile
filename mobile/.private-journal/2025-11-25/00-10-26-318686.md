## Project Notes

Fixed list video feed header overlap issue in video_feed_item.dart.

Root cause: VideoOverlayActions positioned username/follow at viewPadding.top + 16, but list screens (user_list_people_screen, curated_list_feed_screen) add header overlays on top of ExploreVideoScreenPure. The contextTitle parameter was already being passed through the chain but wasn't being used to adjust positioning.

Fix: Check if contextTitle is non-empty (indicating a list header exists) and increase the topOffset from 16 to 80px. The list header in user_list_people_screen is roughly 64px tall (8px padding + 48px IconButton hit area + 8px padding), so 80px gives ~16px clearance.

Code change in lib/widgets/video_feed_item.dart VideoOverlayActions.build():
```dart
final hasListHeader = contextTitle != null && contextTitle!.isNotEmpty;
final topOffset = hasListHeader ? 80.0 : 16.0;
```

Then used at: `top: MediaQuery.of(context).viewPadding.top + topOffset`

This affects both user_list_people_screen (Divine Team list with full header) and curated_list_feed_screen (simpler back button overlay).
