## Project Notes

**OpenVine Blossom Upload Fix (2025-11-27)**

Successfully fixed video upload to blossom.divine.video. The issue was missing `size` tag in the kind 24242 auth event.

Files modified:
- `lib/services/blossom_upload_service.dart` - Added size tag, Content-Length header, debug logging, X-Reason header check
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - Documented the fix

Commits:
- `242bff8` - fix: use standard base64 encoding for Blossom auth headers
- `fece686` - fix: improve Blossom upload auth with size tag and debug logging

Both pushed to main and confirmed working by Rabble.
