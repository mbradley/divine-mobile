## Project Notes

## Riverpod Provider Lifecycle Gotcha

**Discovery**: Class-based `@riverpod` providers are autodispose by default in Riverpod 2.x!

This caused editor's picks to disappear when navigating between tabs because:
- Tab switch → widget unmounts → provider disposed
- Tab return → provider recreated → async initialization → race condition

**Pattern for persistent state**: Use `@Riverpod(keepAlive: true)` for providers that should survive navigation or when watched intermittently.

**When to use autodispose**:
- Request-scoped providers (fetch once, dispose when done)
- Providers only used on single screens
- Memory-sensitive caches

**When to use keepAlive**:
- App-wide state (auth, settings)
- Cross-screen navigation state
- Providers with expensive initialization
- Data that should persist across tab switches
