## Project Notes

**iOS Build Requirement: iPad Multitasking Orientations**

Apple requires ALL four orientations to be declared in Info.plist for iPad apps to support multitasking (split-screen/slide-over), even if the app doesn't actually rotate.

Fixed by adding landscape orientations to `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations~ipad`:
- UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft
- UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight

iPhone can still be portrait-only via `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations` (without ~ipad suffix).

The app can still lock orientation in code using `SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations()`, but the Info.plist must declare all four for iPad to pass App Store validation.
