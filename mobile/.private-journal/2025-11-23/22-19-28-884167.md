## Project Notes

**UI Design Rule: Never Show Video Length**

User confirmed that OpenVine should NEVER display video duration/length anywhere in the UI. This is a core design decision.

This applies to:
- Video cards/thumbnails
- Video player controls
- Video detail screens
- Any video listing or preview

Rationale: Vine-like aesthetic - videos are short loops, duration is not relevant to the UX.
