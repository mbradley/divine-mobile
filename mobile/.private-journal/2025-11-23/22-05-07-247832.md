## Project Notes

cdn.divine.video range request issue:
- The mobile app uses VideoPlayerController which REQUIRES HTTP range requests
- iOS AVPlayer and Android ExoPlayer cannot disable range requests - it's native behavior
- cdn.divine.video is a Cloudflare Worker (backend repo) that's not supporting range requests properly
- Need backend team to fix their worker to support HTTP 206 Partial Content responses

The backend worker needs to:
1. Accept and forward Range headers to R2
2. Return HTTP 206 (not 200) for range requests
3. Include Accept-Ranges: bytes header
4. Include Content-Range header in responses
5. Configure cache settings to handle range requests
