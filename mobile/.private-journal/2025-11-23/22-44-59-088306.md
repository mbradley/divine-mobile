## Project Notes

**Video Playback Issues Found (2025-11-23)**

1. **cdn.divine.video range request bug**: Backend worker doesn't honor Range headers
   - Test: `curl -I -H "Range: bytes=0-1023"` returns HTTP 200 with full file
   - Fix: Backend team needs to implement proper 206 responses

2. **Video disappearing during scrolling bug**: 
   - Root cause: `active_video_provider.dart:129` disposes ALL controllers on every scroll
   - Symptom: Black screen but audio continues
   - Fix: Remove aggressive auto-cleanup, let 5-minute cache timeout handle disposal

**Architecture learnings**:
- video_player requires range requests (iOS AVPlayer, Android ExoPlayer)
- Cannot be disabled via httpHeaders parameter
- VideoPlayerController has 5-minute keepAlive cache in individual_video_providers.dart:108-123
