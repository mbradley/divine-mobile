## Project Notes

Final fix for Explore screen layout overflow applied to `mobile/lib/widgets/composable_video_grid.dart`:
- Changed Flexible to Expanded (line 197)
- Removed mainAxisSize constraints from inner Column (line 200-202)
- Combined with previous fix: removed mainAxisSize from outer Column (line 127)

This ensures grid cells properly allocate space: AspectRatio takes its portion, Expanded fills the rest exactly. No more overflow warnings on video tiles.
