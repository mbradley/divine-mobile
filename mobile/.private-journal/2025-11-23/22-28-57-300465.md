## Project Notes

NEW BUG: Video display disappears but audio continues after many swipes

Symptoms:
- After many rapid swipes through videos
- Video display goes black with play button
- Audio continues playing from previous video
- Only title overlay visible at top

Root cause from logs (22:27:44.151):
1. App became inactive: `App became inactive (keeping foreground state)`
2. Active video changed to null: `Active video changed (b95419fb72b9b3d6ad99e2cbfa2558eb4ef31afbb00d7ed662f9c6c65d6d9da2 → null)`
3. All controllers disposed: `Disposing VideoPlayerController for video 18552cd7bd4f5fb9b4ecffd27d335d20027f04768a6670253e456c23c07d3c92`
4. But UI still showing with play button (not updated)

This is a macOS desktop-specific lifecycle issue where:
- "Inactive" state disposes all controllers
- But window is still visible to user
- Audio keeps playing from non-disposed controller
- Widget tree shows stale state (play button on black screen)

Location: active_video_provider.dart handling app lifecycle changes
Related: individual_video_providers.dart controller disposal

This is SEPARATE from the cdn.divine.video range request issue.
