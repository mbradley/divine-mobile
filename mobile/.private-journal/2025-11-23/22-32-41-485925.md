## Project Notes

CORRECTED UNDERSTANDING: Video disappearing bug happens DURING scrolling, NOT backgrounding

User clarification: Bug occurs while continuously scrolling through many videos, not when backgrounding the app.

Looking at the log pattern:
- 22:27:36-22:27:40: Rapid page changes (index 73→72→73→72)
- Controllers being created/disposed in quick succession
- Each page change triggers: "Active video changed (X → Y), disposing all video controllers"
- Controllers disposed before they finish playing
- Eventually ends with "App became inactive" but that might be a SYMPTOM not cause

Real issue pattern:
1. Rapid scrolling triggers active video changes
2. Each change disposes ALL video controllers (not just inactive ones)
3. New controller created immediately
4. Repeat rapidly
5. Eventually controller state and widget state desync
6. Widget shows black screen + play button, but audio still playing

Root cause likely in:
- active_video_provider.dart: Too aggressive disposal on index change
- individual_video_providers.dart: Controller disposal racing with initialization
- video_feed_item.dart: Widget state not syncing with controller disposal

Need to check if the 5-minute cache timeout is working correctly during rapid scrolling.
