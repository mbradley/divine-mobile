## Project Notes

PendingUpload model issue:
- Currently only has `cdnUrl` field (single URL)
- Upload manager stores `result.cdnUrl` (now fallbackUrl ?? url via getter)
- Publisher tries to access `upload.blossomUploadResult` which doesn't exist
- Need to add fields to PendingUpload for: streamingMp4Url, streamingHlsUrl, fallbackUrl, hlsUrl
- This is a small model change but affects Hive schema (need new HiveField IDs)
- Alternative: Store JSON blob of BlossomUploadResult in PendingUpload
