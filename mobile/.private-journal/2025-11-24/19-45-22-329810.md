## Project Notes

Fixed UserAvatar asset loading issue in diVine app. The red X icons in search results were caused by Image.asset failing to load 'assets/icon/user-avatar.png' without any error handling. Added errorBuilder to Image.asset that falls back to an icon-based placeholder (Icons.person with vineGreen color) when the asset fails to load. This is more robust than relying on bundled assets which can fail in certain scenarios. The fix is in lib/widgets/user_avatar.dart:75-101.
