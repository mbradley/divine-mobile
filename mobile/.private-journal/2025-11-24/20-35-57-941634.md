## Project Notes

Updated share_video_menu.dart with two UX improvements:
1. Combined "Copy Link" and "Share Externally" into a single "Share" button - the native share sheet already has copy functionality built in, so having both was redundant
2. Replaced "Add to Other List (X other lists)" with a visual section showing which lists the video is actually in, with inline remove buttons. Now users can see at a glance which lists contain this video.

Key implementation details:
- Used existing `getListsContainingVideo()` from CuratedListService
- Added `_removeFromList(listId)` method for inline removal
- Used `CuratedListService.defaultListId` (static const) not instance getter
- Green highlight box with vineGreen border to show list membership
- Updated tests to check for "Share" instead of "Copy Link"
